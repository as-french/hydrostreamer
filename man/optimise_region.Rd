\title{Computes and regionalizes optimal estimate from multiple discharge 
timeseries against observed streamflow}
\usage{
optimise_region(HSrunoff, HSobs, routing = "simple", train = 0.5,
  optim_method = "CLS", bias_correction = FALSE, region_type = "upstream",
  no_station = "em", ..., verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{HSrunoff}{An \code{HSrunoff} object containing  runoff
estimates.}

\item{HSobs}{An \code{HSobs} object containing the observed timeseries
for all stations.}

\item{routing}{Routing algorithm to use. See 
\code{\link{accumulate_runoff}} for options.}

\item{train}{The share of timeseries used for training period.}

\item{optim_method}{Method used to optimise. Default uses constrained
linear regression. See details.}

\item{bias_correction}{Apply (constant) bias correction. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{region_type}{How to regionalize combination weights. See details.}

\item{no_station}{How to handle river segments with no downstream 
stations. See details.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to the \code{routing} algorithm.}

\item{verbose}{Whether or not print progress indicators.}
}
\value{
Returns an \code{HSflow} object with one discharge layer (the
  optimized streamflow), and two additional columns in 
  \code{HSflow$river}:
  \itemize{
    \item OPTIMIZED_STATION: Name of the station from HSobs which'
      optimized weights were used at the river segment
    \item OPTIMIZED_riverID: ID of the segment the weighted station
      is located in.
  }
}
\description{
Algorithm routes runoff using user specified routing algorithm, for
each observation point in sequence starting from the most upstream
point. The optimum weight combination is regionalized to the other
river segments which do not contain observation information.
}
\details{
Currently only one regionalization type is implemented: \code{
upstream} uses the weights obtained for the nearest downstream
station for the river segment.

Options for \code{no_station} is currently only one: \code{"em"}, 
which stands for "ensemble mean". For those river segments with no
weights assigned from a station, an ensemble mean (each discharge
prediction is given equal weight) is computed.
