\title{Split river segments at runoff unit (polygon) boundaries.}
\usage{
split_river_with_grid(river, HSgrid, riverID = "riverID",
  gridID = "gridID")
}
\arguments{
\item{river}{An 'sf' linestring feature representing a river network.}

\item{HSgrid}{A 'HSgrid' object, obtained with \code{\link{raster_to_HSgrid}}.}

\item{riverID}{A character string which specifies the name of the column in 
\code{river} containing unique river network identifiers. Defaults to "riverID".}

\item{gridID}{Name of the column in \code{HSgrid} with unique IDs.}
}
\value{
Returns an 'sf' linestring object which has been split at 
  the polygon (grid) boundaries with attributes (columns):
  \itemize{
    \item \emph{ID}. Unique ID of the split river segments.
    \item \emph{riverID}. ID of the original river segment prior 
      to splitting.
    \item \emph{gridID}. ID of the runoff unit split river segment 
      is contained in. 
    \item Other columns inherited from \code{river}.
}
}
\description{
Splits an 'sf' linestring object at the boundaries of 
runoff units (polygons).
