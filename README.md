**hydrostreamer** is an R package designed to allow swift investigation
of surface water resources from existing distributed runoff datasets
with arbitrary areal representations (regular or irregular polygons).

Hydrostreamer workflow generally consists of three steps:

1.  Areal interpolation of runoff to explicit river segments
2.  Routing down the river network to estimate discharge
3.  Model averaging, if streamflow observations are available.

At the bare minimum, discharge can be estimated using only a single
distributed runoff product and a river network. To include model
averaging to the step, one further needs additional runoff datasets to
provide multiple estimates of discharge, and a reference timeseries to
perfgorm model averaging against.

Installing
----------

**hydrostreamer** is not yet on CRAN, so to install, and needs to be
installed from Github.

    # devtools::install_github("mkkallio/hydrostreamer")

Basic usage
-----------

Hydrostreamer includes some example data for demonstration purposes.
First, load example data to R:

    library(hydrostreamer)
    library(raster)
    library(lubridate)
    library(sf)

    data(example_rivers)
    data(example_basins)
    runoff <- brick(system.file("extdata", "runoff.tif", package = "hydrostreamer"))

### 1. Convert raster timeseries to a **HS** object

The first step in hydrostreamer is converting runoff into a *HS* object.
For a runoff input in a raster format, use *raster\_to\_HS()* function.
For input we need the raster, starting date of the timeseries and the
granularity of input timesteps.

    source_runoff <- raster_to_HS(runoff, 
                       date = ymd("1980-01-01"), 
                       timestep = "month", 
                       unit = "mm/s",
                       aoi = st_union(basins),
                       names = "LORA")
    source_runoff

    ##    <int> <named list>                                              <POLYGON [°]>
    ## 1      1 <tibble [396 x~ ((107.5 12.995, 107.5 12.5, 107.31 12.5, 107.31 12.505~

    ## 4      4 <tibble [396 x~ ((107.5 12.5, 107.615 12.5, 107.615 12.485, 107.62 12.~

The output of the function is an sf object with each raster cell as
their own object, and two attributes: an ID and a list column with
timeseries of values for each of the raster cell.

### 2. Interpolate

Next, we interpolate the values in the source zones to individual river
reaches in the river network.

    interpolated_runoff <- interpolate_runoff(source_runoff, river, 
                                              riverID = "SEGMENT_ID")

    ## although coordinates are longitude/latitude, st_intersects assumes that they are planar

    ## # ... with 31 more rows

The warning received here is from the sf package because the coordinate
system in the example dataset is in geographic coordinate system. The
warning goes away if we first project the dataset to an appropriate
coordinate reference system.

The output changes so that zoneID identifying the source of runoff
becomes riverID. runoff\_ts now contains timeseries of the interpolated
runoff at each individual river segment.

### 3. Apply river routing

Next, we route runoff down the river network in order to estimate
discharge at each segment. Since the example data has a monthly
timestep, and the river network is a small one, we use the simplest
routing algorithm available: instantaneous routing. In this routing
method, all runoff is assumed to flow through the entire network at the
timestep it is created.

    streamflow <- accumulate_runoff(interpolated_runoff, routing_method = "instant")
    streamflow

    ## # ... with 31 more rows, and 1 more variable: geom <LINESTRING [°]>

We see that there are now additional columns. NEXT and PREVIOUS give the
routing information for the routing algorithm. discharge\_ts is a list
column which contains timeseries of the estimated runoff, and
UP\_SEGMENTS was created with the routing information, giving the number
of river reaches upstream of each individual reach in the network.

### These functions are pipable

The function usage has been developed so that they are all pipable.

    streamflow <- raster_to_HS(runoff, 
                               date=ymd("1980-01-01"), 
                               timestep="month", 
                               unit = "mm/s",
                               aoi=st_union(basins),
                               names="LORA") %>%
        interpolate_runoff(river, riverID = "SEGMENT_ID") %>%
        accumulate_runoff()

    ## although coordinates are longitude/latitude, st_intersects assumes that they are planar
