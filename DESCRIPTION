Description: hydrostreamer provides functions to downscale distributed runoff data 
  into an explicitly represented river network. Downscaling is done by the spatial 
  relationship between an areal unit of runoff and an overlaid river network. 
  Value of the runoff unit is divided among intersecting river segments. hydrostreamer
  provides several methods for the assignment. Simple river routing algorithms 
  are also provided to estimate discharge at each segment.
