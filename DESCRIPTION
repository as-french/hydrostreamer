Description: hydrostreamer is an R package to downscale off-the-shelf runoff timeseries into explicitly represented 
  river network. Downscaling is done by the spatial relationship between a polygon (raster cell) with runoff information
  and the river network. The cell value is divided among those river segments which intersect the cell in question using
  weights based on catchment area within the cell, or by river segment properties. Simple river routing algorithm is also
  provided to estimate discharge at each segment.
