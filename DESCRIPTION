Description: hydrostreamer provides functions to downscale distributed runoff 
  data on to an explicitly represented river network. Downscaling is done by the 
  spatial relationship between an areal unit of runoff and an overlaid river 
  network. Value of the runoff unit is divided among intersecting river segments
  using weighted interpolation. hydrostreamer provides several methods for the 
  assignment. Simple river routing algorithms are also provided to estimate 
  discharge at arbitrary segment.
